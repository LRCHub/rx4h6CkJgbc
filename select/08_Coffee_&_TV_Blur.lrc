[00:30.36] Do you feel like a chain store
[00:33.66] Pratically floored
[00:38.16] One of many zeroes
[00:42.26] Kicked around bored
[00:51.76] 
[00:45.82] Your ears are full but you're empty
[00:49.59] Holding at your heart
[00:53.73] To people who never really
[00:57.95] Care how you are
[01:05.95] 
[01:02.44] So give me coffee and TV, easily
[01:10.78] I've seen so much, I'm going blind
[01:14.63] And I'm brain-dead virtually
[01:18.92] Sociability is hard enough for me
[01:26.74] Take me away from this big bad world
[01:30.50] And agree to marry me
[01:35.28] So we can start over again
[01:48.28] 
[01:41.37] Do you go to the country?
[01:44.62] It isn't very far
[01:48.83] There's people there that'll hurt you
[01:52.82] Because of who you are
[02:03.82] 
[01:56.91] Your ears are full with their language
[02:00.49] There's wisdom there, you're sure
[02:05.01] 'Til the words start slurring
[02:08.93] And you can't find the door
[02:22.43] 
[02:13.47] So give me coffee and TV, easily
[02:21.85] I've seen so much, I'm going blind
[02:25.52] And I'm brain-dead virtually
[02:29.72] Sociability is hard enough for me
[02:37.78] Take me away from this big bad world
[02:41.49] And agree to marry me
[02:46.20] So we can start over again
[02:59.20] 
[03:24.73] So give me coffee and TV, easily
[03:32.76] I've seen so much, I'm going blind
[03:36.66] And I'm brain-dead virtually
[03:41.09] Sociability is hard enough for me
[03:48.92] Take me away from this big bad world
[03:52.58] And agree to marry me
[03:57.48] So we can start over again
[04:10.48] 
[04:06.66] Oh, we can start over again
[04:18.43] Oh, we can start over again
[04:30.63] Oh, we can start over again
[04:42.35] Oh, we can start over again
