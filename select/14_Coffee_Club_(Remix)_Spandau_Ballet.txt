Matthew didn't stay home
He went abroad instead
Journeys to glory breathing in his head
Got caught up with shoe horns
But he couldn't get a shine
Matthew bought the rap
And read the map without a sign

Contort yourself on disco
With a rap trap white and brown
Caught within the spinning
The key-chain gang went down
No coffee club will have the rub
When product is your answer
Discuss the man, he'll break your plan
It's deep within the dancer...

Wear it on your back now
And summerise you vision
On the train and through the strain
Your own soul decision
Well she had a certain shimmer
She sleeps with him tonight
Stifled love decides where I'm dreaming...

No coffee club will have the rub
When product is your answer
Discuss the man, he'll break your plan
It's deep within the dancer...
